  <description>Metals don't burn. So, stop it! Bad Rimworld.
  
  Updated to work with 1.4
  
  Steel, Plasteel, and Power Conduits don't burn. Silver, Gold, and Power Switches can only burn a little bit.
  
  Also, steel is more durable because... it's steel, and that's how the original version intended it to be. It was also the same in the 1.3 release.
